                    <p>Some women worry that the chemicals used to disinfect swimming pools could harm their baby, but there is no evidence to suggest that your baby could be at risk. You can swim throughout your pregnancy, although you may find it helps to avoid busy times at the pool.</p>

                    <p>How Yoga for Pregnant Women helps--

                        i. Yoga provides holistic health benefits for to-be-mothers.                        
                        ii. Yoga during pregnancy helps keep the body supple. They relieve tension around the cervix by opening up the pelvic region. This prepares to-be-mothers for labor and delivery.
                        iii. Yoga and pranayamas can train you to breathe deeply and relax consciously, helping you face the demands of labor and childbirth.
                        iv. Pregnancy Yoga helps alleviate the effect of common symptoms such as morning sickness, painful leg cramps, swollen ankles, and constipation.
                        v. Yoga asanas also help pregnant women recover faster post-delivery.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Tighten your buttock muscles and tilt your pelvis up, flattening your back against the floor. Hold for a few seconds, then release.</p>

                <li>2. SWIMMING</li>
                <li>3. YOGA</li>
                <li>4. PILATES</li>

                <div class="exercise">

                    <p>It strengthens and stretches your core muscles and could help your body cope with carrying the extra weight of your growing baby, as well as preparing you for childbirth and recovery afterwards.

                        Pilates often focusses on strengthening your pelvic floor, which is important for labour and recovery after birth. A strong pelvic floor can also help you avoid wetting yourself by accident when you cough, sneeze or exercise.</p>
                  </div>

                <li>5. STRENGTH TRAINING</li>

                    </div>
                    <p>Using weights and doing other kinds of strength exercise during your pregnancy will help you:-

                        i. avoid aches and pains as your bump grows
                        ii. strengthen your body for labour
                        iii. prepare for all the lifting, carrying and pram-pushing you’ll be doing after your baby is born.</p>
                  </div>

                <li>6. CYCLING</li>

                <div class="exercise">
                    <div class="animation">
                      <img src="cycling.gif" alt="CYCLING animation">
                    </div>
                    <p>Cycling is a great way to get exercise during pregnancy. Peddling is great for circulation, and it increases cardiovascular fitness, and muscle strength and flexibility. But when you have a baby on the way, road cycling ranks among one of the more hazardous methods of keeping fit, along with horse riding and gymnastics.
                        Do not attempt to cycle if you don’t feel up to it – taking the bus or getting a lift from a friend won’t be the end of the earth – but cycling while fatigued could have horrible consequences.

If you do decide to cycle, safety precautions are an essential (to protect you and your baby); wear a snug-fitting cycle helmet and a high-vis jacket, and make sure your bike is fitted with appropriate lights and reflectors – even if you only cycle during the day.
If you’ve never cycled outside before, then an exercise bike could be just what you need. Exercise bikes are largely thought to be safe at any stage of your pregnancy, but (as always) check with your GP or midwife just to be certain.

                    <p>Proper technique is vital but once you get the hang of doing Kegel exercises, you can do them in any position and in any place.

                        Here are four comfortable positions to begin with:
                        
                        *Kneeling on all fours
                        *Lying down
                        *Sitting
                        *Standing</p>
